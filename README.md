# Practical: Qiskit, VHDL
 simulate the signals from your I2C-inspired Python script using quantum channels and gates in Qiskit, we’ll convert the concept of digital signal states into quantum states. We’ll use qubits to represent SDA and SCL channels, encoding "high" and "low" states as quantum states 
∣0⟩∣0⟩ and ∣1⟩ ∣1⟩. 

The start and stop conditions, as well as the clock pulses, will correspond to specific operations on these qubits, simulating transitions through quantum gates.

# Concept Overview
Qubits as Channels: We can assign two qubits to represent SDA and SCL.
Quantum Gates: We’ll use X, H, and CX (CNOT) gates to simulate changes, such as "start," "stop," and "bit transmission."
Quantum Circuit: The sequence will follow the original logic in your I2C script.

# Explanation of the Qiskit Code

Start Condition: Sets SDA to low (|0⟩) while keeping SCL high (|1⟩), simulating the beginning of communication.
Clock Pulse: Each clock_pulse function call toggles SCL to simulate a pulse.

Send Bit: Adjusts SDA according to the bit value (0 or 1) and follows it with a clock pulse.
Stop Condition: Sets SDA high while SCL is high, signaling the end of communication.
Output and Simulation

The resulting histogram will give you the probability distribution of final states, representing the state of the SDA and SCL channels after running through the transmission steps. This helps analyze the effects of each state transition in a quantum format. You can adapt this model to visualize or measure intermediate states, representing different parts of the communication sequence.

This approach isn’t a direct analog to classical signals but provides insight into how quantum channels and logic gates can represent the same transitions in a quantum framework.
